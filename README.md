# CityGuide-Tourism-Management-System
CityGuide is a Tours and Travel Management App; Java-based SE application developed in NetBeans IDE to reduce the manual work for managing Tourists, Booking, Places etc. The project is totally built at administrative end and thus only the administrator is guaranteed the access to the backend database. 


It is very basic project build to master Java AWT and SWING. Both topics are really easy and fun to work with it.
Go through the project report and then you'll be able install and run it.
Be carefull with the MySql database, as it gets bit tedious to work with it if you're not aware of it already.
After completing this project, I've understood all basic and some advanced Java concepts such as OOPs, Multi-threading, Exception Handling, etc.
